Question 2) We have represented every type with a function that take two arguments. With the definition of all classes we did before, we are just searching if there is a way to combine this two types. 
The way to traverse all classes is with a recursive methode that we have implemented. 
We use sometimes the name but othertime the class to identify the relation between each parameter. 
We have also created a algorithm to compare differents way of solving somes hierarchy problems.
Question 3) Normally that works for the example.
